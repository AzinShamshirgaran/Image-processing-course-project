This folder contains Python code that was demonstrated in lab on Wed. April 7. See CatCourses for the recorded presentation.

The Python code is in Jupyter Notebooks.

You should run the following notebooks in this order:

- one_sine.ipynb
- two_sines.ipynb
- two_sines_consec.ipynb
- two_sines_alt.ipynb
- bird_calls.ipynb

Each notebook does roughly the following:

1) Creates a simple signal (one sine, two added sines, two sines consecutive, two sines alternating) or reads a .wav file.

2) Computes and displays the 1D DFT.

3) Computes and displays the spectrogram.

4) Shows how the spectrogram can be saved as a grayscale image to a file.

The Matlab script explore_spectrogram.m provides an interactive visualization of spectrograms. I only have the Matlab for this.

These directories contain:

- Audio recordings.
- Code to create spectrograms.
- Computed spectrogram images.
- Details of where specific bird calls appear in the audio recordings. These are referred to as Regions of Interest (ROI).
- Code to identify ROIs in spectrogram images.
- Spectrogram images with ROIs highlighted.
- Code to extract ROI subimages.
- ROI images.

All this is for five birds:

DEJU: Dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis)
PSFL: Pacific-slope flycatcher (Empidonax difficili)
SPTO: Spotted towhee (Pipilo maculatus)
WAVI: Warbling vireo (Vireo gilvus)
WIWA: Wilson's warbler (Wilsonia pusilla)

------------------------
1) Recordings directory

Contains 171 .wav files. Each is a 60 second clip containing at least one call from the five birds.

The sampling rate is 44100 Hz.

These are actual field recordings.

You can listen to these audio files using any audio player.

You should listen to some of these audio files while viewing spectrograms using the Raven Lite software which is available for free from https://store.birds.cornell.edu/Raven_Lite_p/ravenlite.htm.

------------------------

2) Code\ComputeSpectrograms directory

Contains the Python Jupyter Notebook compute_spectrogram.ipynb and MATLAB script compute_spectrograms.m

These compute the spectrograms for each of the .wav files in the Recordings directory.

They use a window size of 1024 samples and a window overlap of 512 samples (50%).

They computes the log of the spectrum of the spectrogram. This is scaled to 0 to 1 and saved as a .png file in the directory Spectrograms.

They also saves a .txt file for each spectrogram indicating the time and frequency values of the spectrogram entries.

The file 0_spectrogram_parameters.txt is saved in the Spectrogram directory indicating the parameters of the spectrogram.

------------------------

3) Spectrograms directory.

Contains the spectrograms as .png files as computed above.

(Note that the .zip file already contains these .png files from when I ran the code.)

------------------------

4) ROIs directory

Again, ROIs are the bird calls.

Contains the file birds.csv which has one header row and five bird rows. Each bird row contains the bird name, the .csv file containing the ROI information for this bird (ex: DEJU - Junco hyemalis.csv), and the number of ROIs for this bird.

Five ROI .csv files.

Each contains a header row and a varying amount of ROI rows.

Each ROI row indicates (among other things):

recording: The audio recording with this ROI.
x1, x2: The start and stop time in seconds of the ROI.
y1, y2: The lower and upper frequencies of the ROI.

------------------------

5) Code\Identify_ROIs directory

Contains the Python Jupyter Notebook identify_rois.ipynb and the MATLAB script identify_rois.m

These scripts use the information in the ROI .csv files to mark the ROIs in the spectrogram images and extract the subimages corresponding to the ROIs.

------------------------

6) ROIs\<bird> directories

These contain the spectrogram images with ROIs marked (see files ending with wav.roi.png). Each image contains one or more boxes indicating ROIs. You might have to zoom in to see the boxes.

The original spectrogram images are also here for convenience.

The ROIs subdirectories contain the extracted subimages corresponding to the ROIs for each bird.

(Note that the .zip file already contains these .png files from when I ran the code.)

=====================================================================================

Your tasks:

The eventual goal will be to implement a content-based image retrieval framework in which one of the ROI subimages is the query and the results will be the most similar subimages from the entire collection of ROI subimages. You will develop this framework after I cover image retrieval in the lectures.

Your initial tasks is to try create spectrogram images and ROI subimages that are best suited for image retrieval. The code above uses fairly default spectrogram settings, etc. to compute the spectrograms. You should experiment with these settings plus perhaps other things like noise reduction either in the spectrogram images or audio files.

By *Tuesday, April 13*, you should do the following:

1) Download the Raven Lite software and load the audio files in the Recordings directory to listen to the recordings and view the spectrograms (as generated by the Raven Lite software).

2) Run the Python Jupyter Notebooks *OR* MATLAB scripts:

- compute_spectrograms.*
- identify_rois.*

Look at the code in compute_spectrograms.* to understand in detail how the spectrograms are computed, converted to images, and saved as .png files.

Look at the code in identify_rois.* to understand in detail how the ROI subimages are extracted.

3) Experiment with changing how the spectrograms are computed in compute_spectrograms.* and visualize the results. Some things to modify:

- The window size.
- The window overlap.
- Different ways of creating an image from the spectrogram including the log10 transformation, the scaling to 0 to 1, etc.

Again, the goal will be to create ROI subimages that are effective for the image retrieval problem.

4) Some other things you could experiment with:

- Performing some enhancement of the spectrogram images such as noise removal.
- Subsampling the audio files since the birds seem to limit their calls to lower than 22050 Hz.
- Anything else you can think of at this point.

5) After you have created new spectrograms, extract the ROI submimages (by running identify_rois.*) to see how they look. These are the images you will use in the image retrieval problem.
